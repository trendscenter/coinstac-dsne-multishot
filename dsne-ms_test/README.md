# Decentralized tSNE Multi-Shot (DSNE-MS)

This repository contains code for multi-shot decentralized t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding that was shown to successfully work with the coinstac-simulator

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

coinstac-simulator

```
sudo npm i -g coinstac-simulator
```

### Other Notes
There are two inputspec.json files in the test folder.
One file has one covariate while the other has two covariates.
